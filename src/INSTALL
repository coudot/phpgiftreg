Installation Instructions

1. Unpack phpgiftreg website
2. Create MySQL database
3. Create MySQL tables
4. Create MySQL user (optional)
5. Configure db.php
6. Configure config.php (optional)
7. Create Apache alias

=============================================================================

1. Unpack phpgiftreg website

Change to the directory where you're going to run the website from and 
extract the pages.  The tarball contains the phpgiftreg/ directory itself.

user@host $ tar -xvzf phpgiftreg-x.x.x.tar.gz
<output>

Then give everything the proper permissions (thanks to Paul Hubbard for
pointing this out).  An example would be owner-writable, world-readable:

user@host $ cd phpgiftreg-x.x.x
user@host $ chmod 644 *.php *.css images/*

=============================================================================

2. Create MySQL database

Login to the MySQL server with a user capable of creating databases.  If 
you're running a trusted system, simply executing `mysql' should be adequate.
Otherwise, do something like this:

user@host $ mysql -u username -h host -p
Enter password: <enter password here>
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 626 to server version: 3.23.58-log

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

mysql>

Once inside, create the phpgiftreg database:

mysql> create database phpgiftreg;
Database phpgiftreg created.

=============================================================================

3. Create MySQL tables

<IMPORTANT>
Edit create-phphgiftregdb.sql and scan to the bottom where rows are inserted
into the `users' table.  Change the INSERT statement and add more to create
the users who can initially use the gift registry.  
If you're planning on MD5- or SHA1-hashing your passwords, add an MD5()
or SHA1() call around the password here.
</IMPORTANT>

As well, you can examine the area where the `ranks' table is populated and 
modify that, too.  There's a column for the rank's description and how it 
should look when rendered in HTML.  By default, it shows between 1 and 5 
stars, which should be suitable for most installations.

Change to the phpgiftreg database like this:

mysql> use phpgiftreg;
Reading table information for completion of table and column names
You can turn off this feature to get a quicker startup with -A

Database changed

Run the create-phpgiftregdb.sql script like this:

mysql> source /path/to/create-phpgiftregdb.sql
<lots of activity>

mysql>

=============================================================================

4. Create MySQL user (optional)

You should have a separate user for the database.  If you choose to, create 
the new user like so:

mysql> GRANT ALL ON phpgiftreg.* TO username@host IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

This creates a user called `username' that can connect from `host'.

=============================================================================

5. Configure db.php

Change to the phpgiftreg/ directory and edit the db.php file.  There's a line
with a call to mysql_connect().  Change it to suit your setup.

mysql_connect("host","username","password") 
	or die("Could not connect: " . mysql_error());

=============================================================================

6. Configure config.php

There are some options to change in config.php if you wish.  Their functions
are described in that file.

=============================================================================

7. Create Apache alias

Edit your httpd.conf and add an Alias like so:

Alias /phpgiftreg/ "/path/to/phpgiftreg/"

The trailing slashes are important.  Restart the web server and you should
be good to go.

=============================================================================
