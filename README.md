# PHP Gift Registry

This is a copy of Ryan Walberg's *PHP Gift Registry*, imported from the
original [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/phpgiftreg/) project
page using the [svn2git](https://github.com/svn-all-fast-export/svn2git) tool.

The PHP Gift Registry is a web-enabled gift registry intended for use among a
circle of family members or friends, and allows members to keep track of what
gifts they'd like to receive and see what items other members would like to
receive. Private reservations ensure gifts are not bought twice.

### Features

* Built with Twitter Bootstrap, so it looks great on mobile and small-form
  factor devices.

* Bootswatch integration, so you can replace the theme with a pre-built theme
  by simply copying files.

### More information
